# Welcome to Will's settings.
#

# Config and the environment:
# ---------------------------
# Will can use settings from the environment or this file, and sets reasonable defaults.
#
# Best practices: set keys and the like in the environment, and anything you'd be ok
# with other people knowing in this file.
#
# To specify in the environment, just prefix with WILL_
# (i.e. WILL_DEFAULT_ROOM becomes DEFAULT_ROOM).
# In case of conflict, you will see a warning message, and the value in this file will win.



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Required settings
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The list of plugin modules will should load.
# Will recursively loads all plugins contained in each module.


# This list can contain:
#
# Built-in core plugins:
# ----------------------
# All built-in modules:     will.plugins
# Built-in modules:         will.plugins.module_name
# Specific plugins:         will.plugins.module_name.plugin
#
# Plugins in your will:
# ----------------------
# All modules:              plugins
# A specific module:        plugins.module_name
# Specific plugins:         plugins.module_name.plugin
#
# Plugins anywhere else on your PYTHONPATH:
# -----------------------------------------
# All modules:              someapp
# A specific module:        someapp.module_name
# Specific plugins:         someapp.module_name.plugin


# By default, the list below includes all the core will plugins and
# all your project's plugins.
